# Building GPT From Scratch

This project is based on Andrej Karpathy's tutorial ["Let's build GPT: from scratch, in code, spelled out."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCc8FmEb1nY)

## Overview

This repository contains an implementation of a GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) model built from scratch. The project follows Andrej Karpathy's educational lecture that breaks down the architecture and implementation details of a GPT model in a clear, understandable manner.

## Features

- Implementation of a GPT model from scratch
- Character-level tokenization
- Self-attention mechanism
- Transformer architecture
- Training pipeline
- Text generation capabilities

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- NumPy

## Installation

```
git clone [your-repository-url]
cd [repository-name]
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

```
# Example code for training the model
python train.py

# Example code for generating text
python generate.py
```
